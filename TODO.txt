Last Update: December 2012

IDEAS:  

Add the ability to handle color patterns on creatures.
Add the ability to distinguish which hand/foot equipment is equipped on.  
Add the allegro shader module and figure out ways to take advantage of it (fog? weather? dynamic lighting?).
Figure out a way to use sockets to make our own cache of the map?
Make some DFHack tools available through the Stonesense interface (probe? prospector?)
